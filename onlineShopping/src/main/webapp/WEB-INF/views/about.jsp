			Thanks for stopping by! I'm Saicharan Vennamanani. I am currently
			pursuing my Masters in the field of Computer Science at The
			University of Texas at Dallas. Having learnt nuances of team building
			and working through the deadlines, I have acquired a great knowledge
			on developing scalable, robust and high-value technology solutions. I
			work across all key functional areas including software development,
			web development, databases and testing. I have high regards for team
			building and aren't afraid of taking calculated risks, should it help
			build better solutions. I'm currently seeking Full Time opportunities
			in Software and Web Development. Also check out my <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~sxv157130/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> and if you
			are interested, please head over to the Contact section and shoot me
			an email.
